# Why does this exist

This is just a place for me to play around with Github Pages. I may do something with it at some point but I have no plans for it.


### Since you wasted time coming here..

Help yourself to a python password generator

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import string
from random import *

length = int(input("Enter password length: "))
characters = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation  + string.digits
password =  "".join(choice(characters) for x in range(length))

print(f"\n{password}")
```

### Still Here?

Since you stuck around you can enjoy this picture of my cat. She is not happy you disturbed her while she was sitting in a box though...
